## EXP-001 — Do data-derived inputs make the simulated Monza 2024 look like the real race? (2026-10-12)

```text
Experiment ID:        EXP-001
Research question:    Does starting each car on its real tyre and giving each team a data-estimated
                      car-pace offset bring the simulated finishing order closer to the real one?
Hypothesis:           Yes: higher rank correlation and lower position error than equal cars/all-MEDIUM.
Dataset:              data/manifests/2024_italian_gp_fastf1.yaml (FastF1 3.8.3); 914 representative
                      laps; TSU excluded from estimates (<10 laps) and from scoring (DNF).
Profile revisions:    seed_2024_monza_drivers.yaml v1 (editorial personas, unchanged)
Ruleset + engine:     lightweight_engine_v0.3.0, placeholder lap model (default_lap_model)
Baseline:             A = synthetic defaults (all MEDIUM, car offsets 0)
Model:                B = real lap-1 compounds + team car offsets (D-021), no learned components
Seeds:                1..30, paired (same seeds for A and B); no training involved
Scenario:             full 20-car grid, dry, no pit stops/traffic/lapping (engine limits)
Metrics (mean ± sd):  Spearman vs official order   A 0.743 ± 0.029   B 0.879 ± 0.016
                      mean |position error|        A 3.27            B 1.99
                      B > A on Spearman in 30/30 paired seeds
                      winner team                  A Red Bull 26/30  B McLaren 30/30
                      real podium teams (FER/MCL/MCL) reproduced  A 0/30  B 0/30
Failures / negatives: The real winner (LEC, Ferrari) won on STRATEGY: a one-stop vs McLaren's
                      two-stops. Our engine has no pit stops, so raw pace decides and McLaren
                      always wins. Lapping isn't modelled (Saubers end ~140 s behind instead of a
                      lap down).
Caveats:              In-sample: offsets are estimated from this same race. Not evidence of
                      predictive skill on other races.
Reproduce:            uv run python scripts/fetch_monza_2024.py
                      uv run python scripts/experiments/exp001_data_inputs.py --seeds 30
Decision / next:      Keep data inputs on by default (--synthetic to opt out). M2: pit stops +
                      tyre choice + lapping, so strategy can win races; then re-run as EXP-002 and
                      test out-of-sample on 2024 Belgian GP.

## EXP-002 — The full M2 engine vs two real races: Monza 2024 (in-sample) and Spa 2024 (2026-10-12)

```text
Experiment ID:        EXP-002
Research question:    With pit stops + baseline strategy, traffic, incidents and VSC/SC (engine
                      v0.6.0), how close are simulated races to the real ones, and which parts of
                      the model are furthest off?
Hypothesis:           Order and race time close (data inputs); strategy and overtaking not yet
                      (placeholder tyre/traffic coefficients); incident rates plausible.
Dataset:              data/manifests/2024_italian_gp_fastf1.yaml, 2024_belgian_gp_fastf1.yaml
                      (FastF1 3.8.3). Real metrics from laps/results/track_status tables.
Profile revisions:    seed_2024_monza_drivers.yaml v1; seed_2024_belgian_drivers.yaml v1 (the
                      same personas; SAR template-only). Editorial values.
Ruleset + engine:     lightweight_engine_v0.6.0, world schema v7; placeholder lap/tyre/traffic/
                      incident coefficients (D-010, D-022..D-024)
Baseline policy:      baseline_strategy_v1 (cheapest 0/1/2-stop plan under the model)
Model:                no learned components
Inputs per event:     real start compounds; team car offsets, base lap and pit loss estimated from
                      the SAME race's laps (D-021, D-022, D-026) -> those inputs are in-sample at
                      both tracks. What Spa tests out of sample is everything set at Monza only:
                      personas, tyre/traffic/incident coefficients, strategy, engine structure.
Seeds:                1..30 per event; no training
Method:               overtakes counted identically for real and sim: line-crossing order at each
                      lap end (lap 0 = grid), passes between consecutive lap ends, pairs where
                      either car pitted at the end of either lap excluded.

Findings:
  1. Order and pace: good, and slightly better than EXP-001 at Monza (Spearman 0.879 -> 0.885,
     position error 1.99 -> 1.82). At Spa, 0.905 / 1.86 with Monza-designed coefficients, and
     the official winner HAM wins 20/30 (Mercedes is the fastest car in the Spa data). Caveat:
     car offsets come from each race itself, so this mostly confirms the inputs, not prediction.
  2. Race time within 0.3 min at both tracks (the base lap is estimated from each race).
  3. STRATEGY IS WRONG EVERYWHERE: every simulated finisher one-stops onto SOFT; the real races
     were mostly M->H with many 2-stops (Monza 47 % one-stop, Spa 26 %). The planner is right
     for its model; the placeholder compound offsets/degradation make the soft a race tyre and
     a second stop never pays. This is the single biggest gap.
  4. OVERTAKING IS 2-5x TOO RARE (10 vs 53 at Monza, 17 vs 39 at Spa). Partly a consequence of
     (3): with identical strategies there are few tyre-offset pace differences to pass on;
     partly the editorial traffic parameters (threshold, dirty air, min gap).
  5. Incident/neutralisation rates are consistent with two fully green races with one retirement
     each, but two races are no evidence about rates; season-level data is needed.
  6. LEC's strategy win at Monza still never happens (0/30): it needs (3).
Negative results:     3, 4, 6 above.
Reproduce:            uv run python scripts/fetch_event.py --season 2024 --round 16
                      uv run python scripts/fetch_event.py --season 2024 --round 14
                      uv run python scripts/experiments/exp002_m2_engine.py --seeds 30 \
                          --json docs/experiments/exp002.json
Decision / next:      M4 calibration order: (a) compound offsets + degradation curves (non-linear
                      wear) from stint data, so 2-stops and M->H emerge; (b) overtaking parameters
                      fitted to on-track pass counts with the same counter; (c) incident/SC rates
                      from a season of race-control data. Re-run EXP-002 after each.

## BENCH-001 — Batch headless throughput (2026-10-12)

```text
Command:   uv run python scripts/benchmark.py --races 10 --parallel 64
Machine:   Intel 12th-gen laptop CPU (Family 6 Model 154), 16 logical CPUs, Python 3.12.3;
           the machine was under other load (timings varied 0.6-1.6 s/race across the day)
Workload:  full 20-car Monza race (53 laps, ~9,100 ticks) with every M2 feature, data inputs
Result:    sequential 1.50 s/race (min 0.92), ~6,100 ticks/s, ~2,400 races/hour on one core;
           64 races on 16 processes in 38 s -> ~6,000 races/hour (worker start-up included)
Profile:   ~55 % of a race is pydantic model_copy (one CarState copy per car per tick, ~188k per
           race); cost grows with CarState's field count.
Verdict:   ~145,000 races/day >> the plan's 100 races/day floor for M5. No optimisation needed
           now; if RL needs more, a lap-level fast path or a mutable internal car record behind
           the same API (SIMULATOR_DECISION follow-up 3).
